This is the one file phar installer. It uses PHP's phar extension to install several applications with only one file that must uploaded
to webspace (install.php). The phar content itself is located at the end of file and will detected via __halt_compiler(). The script
will extract the phar file automaticaly if it does not exist and include it's install.php. From now the application will work with
phar's content.
